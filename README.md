## 🏆 Project Overview
This project was developed as a Capstone Project for the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive with Google (2025)**. 

The **AI Data Analyst Agent** is an intelligent assistant that acts as a virtual Data Scientist. It allows users to upload a dataset (CSV) and ask questions in plain English. The agent autonomously writes Python code, executes it to analyze the data, and generates visualizations or statistical summaries instantly.

**Track:** Enterprise Agents  
**Developer:** Ege Kots

## 🚀 The Problem
Data analysis is a critical skill, but it often involves repetitive tasks:
1.  Loading data and checking for errors.
2.  Writing boilerplate code for simple visualizations.
3.  Debugging syntax errors in Pandas or Matplotlib.

For non-technical stakeholders, getting answers from data usually means waiting for a data analyst to write a report.

## 💡 The Solution
This Agent bridges the gap between raw data and insights. By leveraging **Google's Gemini models** and **Code Execution tools**, the agent can:
* **Understand** complex queries about the dataset.
* **Reason** about which statistical method to use.
* **Generate & Run** Python code in real-time.
* **Self-Correct** if the code throws an error.

## ✨ Key Features

* **📈 Automated Visualization:** Can generate bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and histograms on command.
* **🧹 Smart Data Inspection:** Automatically detects column types, missing values, and dataset structure.
* **🐍 Python Code Sandbox:** Generates and executes safe Python code to perform calculations (mean, median, correlation, etc.).
* **🧠 Context Awareness:** Remembers previous questions to allow for follow-up analysis.
